== Working with Kabanero Pipelines

Kabanero uses link:https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/tree/master/docs#usage[Tekton Pipelines] to illustrate a continuous input and continuous delivery (CI/CD) workflow. Each of the featured link:https://github.com/kabanero-io/collections[Kabanero collections] contains a default pipeline that builds the collection, publishes the image to a Docker repo, and then deploys the application to the Kubernetes cluster. You can also create your own tasks and pipelines and add them to the collections. All tasks and pipelines are activated by the link:https://github.com/kabanero-io/kabanero-operator[Kabanero operator].

To learn more about Tekton Pipelines and creating new tasks, see link:https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/master/docs/tutorial.md[the Tekton Pipeline tutorial].

== Kabanero Tasks and Pipelines

Each Kabanero collection contains a set of default tasks and pipelines that are created when the collection is built. The collections build process copies the task and pipeline files from link:https://github.com/kabanero-io/collections/tree/master/incubator/common/pipelines/default[the collections repo] to your `/pipelines` directory.

If you are building a new collection, the default tasks and pipelines are automatically pulled into your collections repo. If you want to customize the default tasks or pipelines to meet your needs, you can choose to apply your changes either to all collections or to a specific collection.  To apply your changes to all the collections,  update the files in the `incubator/common/pipelines/default` directory in your collections repo. If you want to update tasks or pipelines in a particular collection, make your changes in the pipelines directory under that collection in your collections repo.

=== The build and deploy pipeline

link:https://github.com/kabanero-io/collections/blob/master/incubator/common/pipelines/default/build-deploy-pipeline.yaml[Build-deploy-pipeline.yaml]

This file is the primary pipeline that is associated with the collections. It validates that the collection is active, builds the Git source, publishes the container image, and deploys the application. It looks for `git-source` and `docker-image` resources that are used by the `build-task` and `deploy-task` files.

=== Tasks

- link:https://github.com/kabanero-io/collections/blob/master/incubator/common/pipelines/default/build-task.yaml[`Build-task.yaml`]

This file builds a container image from the artifacts in the git-source repository by using link:https://github.com/containers/buildah[Buildah]. After the image is built, the `build-task` file publishes it to the docker-image URL by using Buildah.

- link:https://github.com/kabanero-io/collections/blob/master/incubator/common/pipelines/default/build-task.yaml[`Deploy-task.yaml`]

This file modifies the `app-deploy.yaml` file, which describes the deployment options for the application. `Deploy-task` modifies `app-deploy.yaml` to point to the image that was published and deploys the application by using the Appsody operator. Generate your `app-deploy.yaml` file by running the `appsody deploy --generate-only` command.

By default, the pipelines run and deploy the application in the `+kabanero+` namespace. If you want to deploy the application in a different namespace, update the `app-deploy.yaml` file to point to that namespace.

For more information, see link:https://github.com/kabanero-io/kabanero-pipelines[the kabanero-pipelines repo].

== Running Kabanero pipelines

Explore how to use Kabanero Pipelines to build and manage Kabanero collections.

=== Prerequisites

. link:https://github.com/kabanero-io/kabanero-foundation[Kabanero foundation] must be installed on Red Hat Origin Community Distribution of Kubernetes (OKD) or the OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) cluster.

. link:https://github.com/tektoncd/dashboard[Tekton Dashboard] is installed by default with Kabanero Foundation. To find the Tekton Dashboard URL, log in to your OKD cluster and run `+oc get routes+`, or check in the OKD console. You can also find the dashboard URL from the Kabanero landing page in the OKD or OCP console.

. Dynamic volume provisioning or a persistent volume must be configured. See the following section for details.

=== Getting started

==== Set up dynamic volume provisioning or a persistent volume

Tekton pipelines require a configured volume that is used by the framework to share data across tasks. The build task, which uses Buildah, also requires a volume mount. The minimum required volume size is five Gi.

If your cluster is running in a public cloud, dynamic volume provisioning is the easier option. For more information, see link:https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/master/docs/install.md#how-are-resources-shared-between-tasks[How are resources shared between tasks].

Your persistent volume must be configured in accordance with your cloud providerâ€™s default storage class. Otherwise, your pipelines might create a new volume for each run, which increases your pipeline run execution time.

Alternatively, if you are using an unmanaged cluster, you can set up a persistent volume to be used by the pipeline. A simple persistent volume definition is provided in the following example. Update the path and other values in your `pv.yaml` file to suit your requirements. For instance, the following example is configured for local storage. You might edit this file to configure it for NFS, the standard configuration in a production environment.

. Log in to your cluster. For example, for OKD:


 oc login <master node IP>:8443


. Clone the link:https://github.com/kabanero-io/kabanero-pipelines[kabanero-pipeplines repo]

  git clone https://github.com/kabanero-io/kabanero-pipelines

. Clone the `pv.yaml` file in this repo and apply it.


 cd ./pipelines/common
 oc apply -f pv.yaml -n kabanero


==== Create secrets

Git secrets must be created in the `+kabanero+` namespace and associated with the service account that runs the pipelines. To configure secrets by using the Tekton Dashboard, see link:https://kabanero.io/docs/ref/general/tekton-webhooks.html#create-secrets[Create secrets].

Alternatively, you can link:https://docs.okd.io/latest/dev_guide/secrets.html#creating-secrets[configure secrets in the OKD console or set them up by using the OKD CLI].

=== Execute pipelines by using the Tekton Dashboard Webhook Extension

You can use the link:https://github.com/tektoncd/experimental/blob/master/webhooks-extension/docs/GettingStarted.md[Tekton Dashboard Webhook Extension] to drive pipelines that automatically build and deploy an application whenever you update the code in your Git repo. Events such as commits or pull requests can be set up to automatically trigger pipeline runs.

=== Execute pipelines by using a script

If you are developing a new pipeline and want to manually test it in a tight loop, you might want to use a script or manually drive the pipeline.

. Log in to your cluster. For example for OKD,

 oc login <master node IP>:8443

. Clone the Kabanero pipelines repo.

 git clone https://github.com/kabanero-io/kabanero-pipelines


. Run the following script with the appropriate parameters.


  cd ./pipelines/incubator/manual-pipeline-runs/

  ./manual-pipeline-run-script.sh -r [git_repo of the Appsody project] -i [docker registery path of the image to be created] -c [collections name of which pipeline to be run]"

 For example:


 ./manual-pipeline-run-script.sh -r https://github.com/mygitid/appsody-test-project -i index.docker.io/mydockeid/my-java-microprofile-image -c java-microprofile"


=== Execute pipelines manually from the command line

. Log in to your cluster. For example, for OKD:


 oc login <master node IP>:8443

. Clone the Kabanero pipelines repo.


 git clone https://github.com/kabanero-io/kabanero-pipelines
 cd kabanero-pipelines


. Create Pipeline resources. +
Use the `pipeline-resource-template.yaml` file to create the `PipelineResources`. The `pipeline-resource-template.yaml` is provided in the Kabanero pipelines link:https://github.com/kabanero-io/kabanero-pipelines/tree/master/pipelines/incubator/manual-pipeline-runs[`manual-pipeline-runs` directory]. Update the docker-image URL. You can use the sample GitHub repo or update it to point to your own GitHub repo.

. After you update the file, apply it as shown in the following example:

 oc apply -f <collection-name>-pipeline-resources.yaml


=== Activate tasks and pipelines

The installations that activate the featured collections also activate the tasks and pipelines. If you are creating a new task or pipeline, activate it manually, as shown in the following example.

```
oc apply -f <task.yaml>
oc apply -f <pipeline.yaml>
```

=== Run the pipeline

A sample `manual-pipeline-run-template.yaml` file is provided in the link:https://github.com/kabanero-io/kabanero-pipelines/tree/master/pipelines/incubator/manual-pipeline-runs[`/pipelines/manual-pipeline-runs` directory]. Rename the template file to `pipeline-run.yaml`, for example, and update the file to replace `collection-name` with the name of your collection. After you update the file, run it as shown in the following example.

```
oc apply -f <collection-name>-pipeline-run.yaml
```

== Checking the status of the pipeline run

You can check the status of the pipeline run from the OKD console,
command line, or Tekton dashboard.

=== Checking pipeline run status from the Tekton dashboard

. Log in to the Tekton Dashboard and click `Pipeline runs'
in the sidebar menu.

. Find your pipeline run in the list and click it to check the status and find logs. You can see logs
and status of each step and task.

=== Checking pipeline run status from the command line

Enter the following command in the terminal:

```
oc get pipelineruns
oc -n kabanero describe pipelinerun.tekton.dev/<pipeline-run-name>
```

You can also see pods for the pipeline runs, for which you can specify `+oc describe+` and `+oc logs+` for to get more details.

If the pipeline run was successful, you can see a Docker image in our Docker registry and a pod thatâ€™s running your application.
